I think the fundamental difference between the tester and the developer is the difference between synthesis and analysis. The developer synthesizes code. He builds up things, putting pieces together and figuring out fun and unique ways of combining those distinct little bits to do wonderful and amazing things.

Testers are all about analysis. Once it has all been put together, the tester likes to take it apart again, piece by piece, this time looking for those little corners, edges, and incongruities that hide in those weird and strange interactions that come from those new and amazing ways of putting pieces together.

Both testers and developers like figuring out how things work, but the difference is where the developer is focused on putting things together to make them work a certain way, the tester is focused on taking things apart to find out all those unintended consequences.

I think an EXCELLENT developer has some of that tester in them because it is in finding out those strange and weird interactions that come from analysis is how they find out new wonderful and amazing things to build. Likewise EXCELLENT testers need a good sense of synthesis to be able to know how to put the things together to create those new wonderful things so that they can better understand how they come apart again.
