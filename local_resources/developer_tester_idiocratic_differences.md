In my experience, developers tend to be optimistic folks, while testers tend to be more pessimistic.

This does lead to some interesting contrasts...


| Optimistic Developer | Pessimistic Tester |
| -------------------- | ------------------ |
| The glass is half full | The glass is twice as big as required |
| This code hasn't yet been tested. It's not known if it has any bugs | This code hasn't yet been tested. It's not known if it actually works |
| We are 90% done |  We don't know when we'll be done, if ever |
| We will refactor the code to make it better |  They are throwing out the working code and replacing it with an unknown quantity |
| I only changed one line of code |  The entire system must be retested |
| The code is the design |  There is no design |
| We'll fix those bugs later, when we have time |  We never have enough time to fix the bugs |
| This build is feature complete |  The features exist; some are completely broken|
| Anything is possible, given enough time |  Everything has flaws, and given enough time I can prove it  |
| Of course it will work |  It might work, but probably won't|
| One last bug fix, and we can ship tomorrow |  Fixing this one bug will likely lead to two more |
| Stop finding bugs, or we'll never be done |  Stop creating bugs, so I can find them all |
| There's no need for more tests |  Let's just run a few more tests to be sure |
| There is no I in TEAM |  We can't spell BUGS without U|
| That's an "undocumented feature" |  That's a bug |
| I like to build things |  I like to break things |
| Sure, we can use the Beta version of this component in Production |  We should wait until version 2.1 |
| Willing to bet that there are no more bugs |  Willing to take that bet |
| Let's slip these changes in now, because I'm  |arting my vacation tomorrow |  Let's not |
| That will never happen in Production |  Never is a long time |
| It works on my machine |  Perhaps your machine is the only one where it works? |
| The sun'll come out, tomorrow... |  Raindrops keep fallin' on my head... |
| I'm a Realist |  I'm a Realist |
